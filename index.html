        <strong>
          <p2>So, my life's passion has always been rather,,, extraordinary pets. 
            At the moment I have two frogs, two gecko's, nine tarantulas, a bunch of bugs, a snake and a cat. </p2>
          <p2>From a young age I've always done art. Usually drawing cartoons and such.
            In the last few years, I've been focusing on digital art and character design.
            My art style has been developed trough the media I've consumed in my childhood, thus i like to draw 
            stuff that can be a bit creepy at times.</p2>
          <p2>Whenever I'm having a rough time getting up in the mornings, 
            I think to myself 'build a better future for your reptiles' and then life gets a bit easier! </p2>

      <h2>Experience</h2>
        <article><strong><p> So, my working experience at office jobs is 
          from my internship. At my last study I did           
          a year of internship at three companies.           
          My favourite one was at OkHuizen, although            
          being able to work at YuconVR was very            
          impressive. Why I liked OkHuizen more            
          was because I had the opportunity to            
          learned more. My products actually got           
          printed in mass amounts and I took pride            
          in that, even if it might seem small.            
          I liked the way I could communicate with           
          my coordinator/mentor as he gave me more  
          responsibility than most would have in  
          his place. This really allowed me to  
          grow and learn valuable planning skills and such. </p></article>
