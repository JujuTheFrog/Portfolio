          <p>So, my life's passion had always been rather, extraordinary pets. 
            At the moment I have two frogs, two gecko's, nine tarantulas, a bunch of bugs, a snake and a cat. </p>
          <p>From a young age I've always done art. Usually drawing cartoons and such. 
            In the last few years, I've been focusing on digital art and character design. </p>
          <p>Whenever I'm having a rough time getting up in the mornings, I think to myself 'build a better future for your reptiles' and then life gets a bit easier! </p>

  <h2>Experience</h2>
    <article><p>So my working experience at office jobs is from my internship. 
      At my last study I did a year of internship at three companies. 
      My favorite one was at OkHuizen although being able to work at YuconVR was very impressive. 
      Why I liked OkHuizen more was because I learned more. 
      My products actually got printed in mass amounts and I took pride in that, even if it might seem small. </p></article>
